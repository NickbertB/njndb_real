<h1 class="title">Assist With Your Build</h1>


<p>If you have already begun your build on your own and have encountered issues, we can help you.</p>
<p>When you schedule your consultation, simply have a list of the components you have already bought, and let NJN Design & Build help you with any step of the process.</p>
<p>We enjoy turning this into a teaching process as we walk you through your build. However, we understand that people are busy, so if you would like, we can simply complete whatever work you would like and you can come back when it's all done. Just let us know.</p>
